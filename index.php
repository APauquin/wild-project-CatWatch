                    Cats worldwide have begun rigorous cardiovascular training programs.
                    Experts say cats have begun these exercises in order to hunt down children more efficiently.
                    A 30% net increase in child mortality is expected in the years to come.
                    Cat owners assure the public they're "just playing".
